            <h2>Best Form Practices </h2>
            <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best Practices for Form Design</a>, emphasized how significant of a difference certain changes can make in a website. One of the practices that I agree with is differentiating between the optional and required fields. When this is made easily understandable in a website, it allows the user to move through the form efficiently. Although it is important to not overuse the asterisk, if every question is required then that must be made clear early on. </p>
              
	        <p>Another practice that I got to learn more about is when it’s appropriate to use drop down menus. If there are 5 items or less, then one should use a button or selection boxes instead. It’s better to keep the drop down menus for fields that have a lot of options, but only one answer needs to be selected. It should also be stacked vertically so it’s easier for the user to scan and read through the form. It’s essential that the user stays in the flow when completing forms, otherwise there is a higher chance of them leaving it incomplete due to complications.
            </p>
	       <p>One of the most important practices is accessibility. As designers, we need our work to be available to everyone in order to get our information delivered correctly. By making the page easier to navigate and read, we are able to expand our audience. Making sure the page has proper contrast, readability, and symbols provide an opportunity for more people to access a page. 
            </p> 
            <p>A site that comes to mind that displays these practices is <a href="https://registrar.ucdavis.edu/registration/register-for-classes/schedule-builder">Schedule Builder </a>    for UC Davis. The website allows you to search for classes and register through a click of a button. If something is done incorrectly or not filled out, there will be a warning message at the top. One can also scroll through the schedule options and choose to drop or add a class from a drop down menu.
