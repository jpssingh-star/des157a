        This morning I went to Moo Moo's Cafe, the most <span>adj</span> place in town. 
        A <span>adj</span> cow wearing a <span>noun</span> was by the counter and <span>verb</span>-ed me. 
        “What can I make for you today?” she asked. 
        I decided to order a <span>adj</span> <span>drink</span> with <span>flavor</span>. 
        “Make it extra <span>adj</span> please!” The moo-rista began to <span>verb</span> behind the counter. 
        She made my drink very <span>adj</span> and <span>adj</span> and put it in a <span>noun</span>. 
        I got my drink and it was <span>adj</span> and full of <span>noun</span>. 
        I <span>verb</span>-ed and left.
